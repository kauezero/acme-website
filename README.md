# acme-website

Responsive website made as a study.

The layout was based on [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw) by Traversy Media.

The code was written from scratch updating some dated stuff like the use of floats to flexbox and grid. Also used CSS variables where possible and made changes to the layout.
